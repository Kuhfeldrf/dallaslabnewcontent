# Getting Started: Your Guide to Our Research Services

## What Information Do We Need From You?

**Q: What should I prepare before contacting you about a project?**

A: **Essential Information:**
- **Your products or samples** - What you're working with (milk, formula, cheese, protein powders, etc.)
- **Your business challenge** - What problem you're trying to solve or goal you want to achieve
- **Target outcomes** - What you hope to learn or prove
- **Timeline considerations** - When you need results
- **Budget expectations** - Scope and complexity level you can support


**Don't worry if you don't have all this information** - we can help you define requirements through consultation and often work with limited initial information to design pilot studies.

## Choosing the Right Services for Your Needs

**Q: How do I know which services I need?**

A: Use this decision framework based on your primary goals:

**If you want to understand what's in your products:**
- **Protein & Peptide Analysis** - Comprehensive identification and quantification of proteins and bioactive peptides
- **Method Development** - If existing analytical methods don't work for your specific products

**If you need to prove your products actually work:**
- **Functional Analysis** - Test biological activities and health benefits
- **In Vitro Digestion** - Understand what happens to your products in the human digestive system

**If you need documentation and regulatory support:**
- **Scientific Writing** - Literature reviews, regulatory submissions, technical reports, and scientific publications

**If you're not sure what you need:**
Start with a consultation - we'll discuss your business challenges and recommend the optimal analytical approach. Many successful partnerships begin with pilot studies to demonstrate value before committing to larger projects.

## Common Project Types & Applications

**Q: What types of projects do you typically work on?**

A: We work on a wide variety of projects, ranging from complex clinical studies and laboratory experiments to straightforward literature reviews and data analyses. Whether your project is large or small, we can tailor our approach to meet your specific research needs.

**Product Development & Optimization:**
- Understanding how processing conditions affect protein quality and bioactivity
- Discovering new bioactive compounds in dairy products
- Optimizing formulations for maximum health benefits
- Comparing human milk vs bovine products or proteins

**Regulatory & Claims Support:**
- Generating evidence for health claims and functional food applications
- Safety assessments for novel food approvals
- GRAS submission documentation

**Infant Nutrition (Specialized Expertise):**
- Optimizing infant formula composition for appropriate protein breakdown
- Studying how products affect developing digestive systems
- Comparing bioactivity of different milk sources for infant products
- Regulatory support for pediatric nutrition applications

## Collaboration Models

**Q: How do partnerships typically work?**

A: We partner with industry and academia through both fee-for-service projects and longer-term research collaborations.

**Contract Research:**
- You define the problem; we design and execute the analytical solution
- Fixed scope projects with defined deliverables and timelines
- Ideal for specific questions or regulatory requirements

**Collaborative Partnerships:**
- Joint development of research questions and experimental design
- Shared intellectual property and co-authored publications
- Long-term relationships supporting ongoing product development

**Academic Collaborations:**
- Graduate student projects addressing your specific research questions
- Access to cutting-edge research and academic networks
- Opportunities for co-authored publications and conference presentations

## Sample Requirements & Logistics

**Q: Can you perform analysis on my sample?**

**Sample Types We Work With:**
- **Liquids** - Milk, whey, beverages, formula solutions 
- **Powders** - Protein powders, infant formula, supplements 
- **Processed Products** - Cheese, yogurt, fermented products
- **Ingredients** - Individual proteins, peptides, bioactive compounds
- **Process Samples** - Materials from different manufacturing stages
- **Biological Samples** - Blood, stool, digesta, tissue samples, biological fluids
- **Other** - non-dairy products or proteins (soy, meat, yeast, ingredients)

**Sample Handling:**
- We accommodate special storage requirements (frozen, refrigerated, dry)
- Can work with small quantities for initial feasibility studies
- Provide guidance on optimal sampling and shipping procedures
- Handle confidential samples with appropriate agreements
