# Understanding Peptidomics & Proteomics: Your Questions Answered

## What We Do

**Q: What exactly are peptidomics and proteomics, and why should I care about them for my dairy products?**

A: Think of proteins as the workhorses of milk - they provide nutrition, structure, and biological activity. Proteomics is the comprehensive study of all proteins in your sample, telling you what proteins are present, how much of each, and how they've been modified. Peptidomics focuses on the smaller pieces - peptides that form when proteins break down during processing, digestion, or storage. These peptides often have powerful bioactive properties that can enhance health benefits, improve functionality, or serve as quality markers for your products.

**Q: How can this analysis help my business?**

A: Our analysis can help you:
- **Optimize processing conditions** - See exactly how heat treatment, fermentation, or other processes affect your protein content
- **Discover bioactive compounds** - Identify peptides with health benefits like antioxidant, antimicrobial, or blood pressure-lowering properties
- **Improve quality control** - Develop protein-based markers to ensure consistent product quality
- **Support health claims** - Generate scientific data to back up nutritional and functional claims
- **Innovate new products** - Understand which processing conditions create the most beneficial peptides

## Our Analytical Capabilities

**Q: What makes your analysis different from standard protein testing?**

A: Traditional protein testing might tell you total protein content, but we provide the complete molecular story. Using advanced mass spectrometry, we can:
- Identify individual proteins down to their exact molecular structure
- Quantify specific proteins and peptides with high precision
- Track how proteins change during processing or storage
- Discover new bioactive peptides unique to your products
- Analyze post-translational modifications that affect protein function
