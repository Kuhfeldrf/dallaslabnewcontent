# Understanding Method Development: Your Questions Answered

## What We Do

**Q: What is method development and why would I need it for my dairy products?**

A: Method development is creating entirely new analytical approaches when existing methods don't exist or aren't suitable for your specific needs. Dairy products present unique analytical challenges - high fat content, complex protein matrices, diverse peptide populations, and interfering compounds that can overwhelm standard analytical methods. When you need to analyze novel bioactive compounds, track specific modifications, or work with challenging sample types that existing methods can't handle, we develop custom mass spectrometry approaches tailored specifically to your analytical challenges.

**Q: When do I need custom method development versus standard analysis?**

A: Consider method development when:
- **Your compounds aren't covered by existing methods** - Novel bioactive peptides, new protein modifications, or emerging ingredients
- **Standard methods fail in your matrix** - Complex dairy products that interfere with conventional extraction or analysis
- **You need cutting-edge capabilities** - Advanced techniques like top-down proteomics or glycopeptidomics that require specialized approaches
- **Regulatory requirements demand validated methods** - Custom methods with full validation documentation for regulatory submissions
- **You're pushing analytical boundaries** - Detecting trace compounds, analyzing complex mixtures, or requiring exceptional sensitivity
